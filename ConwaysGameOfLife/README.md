# Conway's Game of Life
Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway in 1970. It has the four following simple rules:
1. Any living cell with less than two living neighbouring cells dies.
2. Any living cell with two or three living neighbouring cells survives.
3. Any dead cell with three living neighbouring cells becomes alive.
4. Andy living cell with more than three living neighbouring cells dies.
